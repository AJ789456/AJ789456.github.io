    <h1>Why a Portfolio?</h1>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I created a portfolio because it is a good place to document all the projects I create over the years. It will be an easily accessible place for me to show other people what I have created. A digital portfolio can be useful for anyone from an artist to an animator to a software devolper. It makes even more sense for someone planning to work in IT because creating a website from scratch is an accomplishment itself. By creating a digital portfolio I will be able to show potential employers what I have done so that they know how much experience I have and likely receive a higher wage than I would have without a digital portfolio.</p>
