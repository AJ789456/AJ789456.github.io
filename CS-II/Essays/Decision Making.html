    <h2 style="color:white;font-family:timesnewroman;margin-left:25%">Survivorship Bias</h2>
    <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;font-size:110%;line-height:2;margin-right:25%;margin-left:25%;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The survivorship bias occurs when one, only considering examples of successful individuals in society, oversimplifies the event leading up to success. They will often try to replicate the actions of those specific individuals in order to achieve the same success. For example, someone who is studying successful CEOs in the US without studying unsuccessful CEOs. This may lead to one overestimating their chances of success.

    <h2 style="color:white;font-family:timesnewroman;margin-left:25%">Confirmation Bias</h2>
    <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;font-size:110%;line-height:2;margin-right:25%;margin-left:25%;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The confirmation bias occurs when one uses information that supports their own beliefs without considering the opposing beliefs. This happens because views that support our own preconceptions please us. For example, if one is leftist, continuing to read articles from others with leftist views will subject them to confirmation bias since they do not consider the view of the right wing. This simply leads to a very strong opinion about one side. 
    </p>
    <h2 style="color:white;font-family:timesnewroman;margin-left:25%">Overconfidence Bias</h2>
    <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;font-size:110%;line-height:2;margin-right:25%;margin-left:25%;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The overconfidence bias occurs when one is overly confident in their own abilities. This bias makes one deceive themselves. For example, if someone has successfully traded stock for many years, they might become overconfident and make a hasty decision. This may lead to one taking large risks since they believe it will go well for them.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color:white;font-family:timesnewroman;margin-left:25%">Authority Bias</h2>
    <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;font-size:110%;line-height:2;margin-right:25%;margin-left:25%;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The authority bias occurs when one believes the words of someone in authority rather than the words of someone speaking wisely. For example, believing the words of a corrupt politician rather than the words of an educated student. This may lead to beliefs controlled by people in authority.
