    <h2 style="color:white;font-family:timesnewroman;margin-left:25%">Survivorship Bias</h2>
    <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;font-size:110%;line-height:2;margin-right:25%;margin-left:25%;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The survivorship bias occurs when one, only considering examples of successful individuals in society, oversimplifies the event leading up to success. They will often try to replicate the actions of those specific individuals in order to achieve the same success (Nikolopoulou, 2022). The survivorship bias can also be considered an undercoverage bias because people may not reach out to those who have been unsuccessful to find out what they did wrong. For example, someone who is studying successful CEOs in the US without studying unsuccessful CEOs. This may lead to one overestimating their chances of success. In my ISP, if we fall victim to the survivorship bias, we may only look at successful businesses without considering the failed business which may lead to us overestimating our chance at making a successful business. To avoid the survivorship bias, we can make sure our data is complete (as in including all the data about successful and failed businesses) and accurate.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color:white;font-family:timesnewroman;margin-left:25%">Confirmation Bias</h2>
    <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;font-size:110%;line-height:2;margin-right:25%;margin-left:25%;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The confirmation bias occurs when one uses information that supports their own beliefs without considering the opposing beliefs. This happens because views that support our own preconceptions please us (Casad & Duignan, n.d.). For example, if one is leftist, continuing to read articles from others with leftist views will subject them to confirmation bias since they do not consider the view of the right wing. This simply leads to a very strong opinion about one side. In my ISP, if we fall victim to the confirmation bias, we may design our application in a way that we believe will please the public when, in reality, our design only satisfies the narrow group of people that have similar interests as us. To avoid the confirmation bias, we should deliberately find data that opposes our view to see how much of the population shares that view.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color:white;font-family:timesnewroman;margin-left:25%">Overconfidence Bias</h2>
    <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;font-size:110%;line-height:2;margin-right:25%;margin-left:25%;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The overconfidence bias occurs when one is overly confident in their own abilities. This bias makes one deceive themselves, mostly due to ego or pride. Since almost no one believes that they have below average skills, most people are at least somewhat biased by this bias (CFI Team, 2022). For example, if someone has successfully traded stock for many years, they might become overconfident and make a hasty decision. This may lead to one taking large risks since they believe it will go well for them. In my ISP, if we fall victim to the overconfidence bias, we may release our application before it is truly bug free because we are overconfident in our ability to program; publishing the application at this stage would be a big risk that would result in backlash from our users. To avoid the overconfidence bias, we must not think highly of ourselves and fear failure.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color:white;font-family:timesnewroman;margin-left:25%">Authority Bias</h2>
    <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;font-size:110%;line-height:2;margin-right:25%;margin-left:25%;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The authority bias occurs when one blindly believes the words of someone in authority. This bias in humans has developed for hundreds of years because we naturally stay in groups led by a leader (Dsouza, n.d.). For example, believing the words of a corrupt politician rather than the words of an educated student. This may lead to beliefs controlled by people in authority. In my ISP, we may fall victim to the authority bias if we assign one person to the leader of the ISP group and create whatever he or she demands without considering the integration or design of those elements. To avoid the authority bias, we should think logically, ignore the person's role in society, and question their decisions. If they still seem right after an unbiased review, then you can listen to them. Specifically in our ISP, we may not assign a team leader so that we avoid this bias.

    <h2 style="color:white;font-family:timesnewroman;margin-left:25%;">Availability Bias</h2>
    <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;font-size:110%;line-height:2;margin-right:25%;margin-left:25%;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The availability bias occurs when one makes decisions based on information that is easily accessible or recent experiences. The human brain will use any easily accessible  information available to it to come to a quick decision, but most of this information will be recent memories which may not include the whole picture (Gleason & Simon, 2021). For example, if you live on the wealthy side of town and you want to find out the most common shoe brand, you may think back to all the Gucci shoes you’ve seen, but you don’t know about the other 70% of the town that wear Skechers. In my ISP, we may fall victim to the availability bias if we only consider what we have seen people showing interest in, without actually asking them what they think makes a good product. To avoid this bias, you must consider all data relevant to your problem and not consider only the easily accessible information.
