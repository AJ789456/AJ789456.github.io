    <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;font-size:110%;line-height:2;margin-right:50%;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The main purpose of an HTTPS connection is to encrypt data so that the connection is more secure and more private. An HTTPS connection is also used to make sure that the website is authentic and trustworthy. A technology known as HTTPS Proxy Appliance, however, has been developed. This technology gives organizations full access to everything we do in the browser. The HTTPS Proxy Appliance works by creating a fake website certificate that allows them to mimic the website the user wanted to visit. A MITM (Man in the Middle) attack is when an individual intercepts your connection to a website and steals the data you input. They can do this by creating a WiFi hotspot that you accidentally connect to and then accessing all of your online data exchanges. A hash is a complex algorithm that turns an input into an encrypted output. A good hash shouldn’t give the same output for 2 different inputs, and it should be difficult to guess the output from the input. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A CA is a Certificate Authority. They are responsible for giving (or rejecting) a website a certificate after reviewing the physical material provided by the website. A browser uses the CA’s certificate to determine if it should establish a connection with that website. Unfortunately, an SSL interception cannot be prevented, but it can be detected. An SSL interception can be detected by creating a cryptographic hash of the SSL certificate. Since hashes are so sensitive, the server’s real certificate and the SSL Appliance’s fake certificate will have very different fingerprints. A false-positive usually happens with big companies that use multiple certificate providers. You may think that you are being intercepted because of a “wrong” fingerprint when you have simply received a certificate from a different certificate provider. A false-negative is when you think you are not being intercepted but you actually are. There is a limit to how much they can eavesdrop on us. I think it is fine if they know what website we visit (like youtube.com), but they should not be able to know what we do on that website (like watching cat videos). So they should make a compromise so that they don’t upset their people but still do what they want to do.
