    <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;font-size:110%;text-align:center;margin-right:0%;">  <br><br> <strong>AI Sentience</strong> <br><br> Avanish Jeendru <br><br> Allen High School STEAM Campus <br><br> Advanced Computer Science II <br><br> Mr. Ben-Yaakov <br><br> September 2, 2022 <br> <br> </p>
    <p style="font-family:timesnewroman;font-size:110%;line-height:2;margin-right:25%;margin-left:25%;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are many problems and risks associated with artificial intelligence. Many people fear that AI may one day take people’s jobs or that AI such as deepfake technology will be used for crimes. That said, as of now, the benefits of AI are much greater than any of the risks. Today’s AI is helping us solve many problems and AI is not yet good enough to commit crimes or replace people in their jobs.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AI is helping solve problems that have been puzzling humans for a long time. For example, recently, DeepMind’s AlphaFold AI system was able to solve the protein-folding problem, something that biologists have been struggling to solve for many years. The data that AlphaFold has given humans will help in the world of medicine for years to come (Roose, 2022). We know that computers are faster at processing than humans (just look at a calculator), so if we can teach computers more than first grade level math, imagine where it could take humanity. The COVID threat would have been eliminated by the time it was discovered.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AI is also yet not good enough to replace humans at any task today. The recently popularized DALL-E 2 is able to take in natural language input and create original images from the description given. Although some may argue that this technology is on the verge of putting artists out of business, the images DALL-E 2 creates are not as consistent as something a human could create (Roose, 2022). The images are often good, but it struggles with many of the details like fingers on a hand. DALLE-2 still needs years of refinement before it can produce work that is acceptable enough to be used in the industry.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When AI does get good enough to replace humans, humans must start changing their ways so that they can evolve and move into the next era. It will be a signal that people need to stop working at McDonald's and start devoting their energy to something more important.
