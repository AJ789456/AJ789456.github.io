    <p><strong>Techincal Challenges:</strong></p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This week there were relative few technical challenges because we are still in the process of designing our website and working out roles within the team. We did, however, set up Github and learned how to use the issues feature. As soon as we figure out the design of the site and who is working on what, we will start programming and, as a result, start facing techincal challenges.</p>
    <p><strong>Scheduling Challenges:</strong></p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Scheduling is a somewhat large issue; we are about 2 weeks in and we are still solving issues with communication and role assignment. We have not started working on the actually product and the deadline is about 7 weeks away. This week we think we finalized the roles and the MVP, but we are not sure if everyone that wasn't at our meeting agrees, another communication problem.</p>
    <p><strong>Interpersonal Challenges:</strong></p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have been facing many interpersonal challenges from the lack of communication to the type of communication. Since most of our team members are split up, we are having a hard time knowing what each person is doing. This is also furthered by the fact that not all of us know each other. We tried solving the lack of communication by creating a Discord server, but threats are being made on the server due to the arrogance of some specific team members.

    <p><strong>Technical Challenges:</strong></p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This week we faced no techinal challenges since we are still in the plannning phase of our ISP. Once we start actually creating the site in html we will start to face techincal problems. But technically a major challenge that we are still facing is we need to design the site as a team. The design of the site is very important because it dictates the process of building the site.</p>
    <p><strong>Scheduling Challenges:</strong></p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since our ISP is something that the school needs and not just a computer science assignment, our project will probably have a much earlier deadline than the ISPs that other students are working on. Also, everyone in my team is not in the class period, so we have not communicated with each other much. Therefore, each of our envisioned timelines are different so we must meet so that we can create a common timeline.</p>
    <p><strong>Interpersonal Challenges:</strong></p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Everyone in my team has different computer science class periods, so we have had almost zero communication so far. Some of us have created our own design or started create a website on our own, but none of us have met with one another to discuss how the final project will look like. So, this week we have set that communication platform up. We will have to put together everyone ideas and come up witha design we can all agree on which will probably be harder than we think.</p>
    <p><strong>Intial Roles:</strong></p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Software Devlopment Engineer: The development engineer will a common role in our group. The people with this role will be in charge of programming the site and making our design a reality. I might be okay at this role because I have been in programming for several year now and I am fairly decent at it. But, I do not have much experience with HTML, the language that we will be using for this website. This should not be to big of a problem though because of the vast amount of online resourse I can use to help me program in HTML.</p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; QA Engineer: The quality assurance engineer will check the designs and website as it is being create to ensure it reach a certain standard. They will mak sure that our website isn't released to the school before all bugs and design imperfection are removed. I think this role will suit me because I have good attention to detail a necessary trait for quality assurance engineers. One challenge I will most likely face as a QA engineer is making sure I through test the website to make that ALL bugs are removed. This will be difficult I will have to check everything on the website.</p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Project Manager: The project manager will be in charge of leading the team and making sure that everyone is communicating with each other. The project will go down hill if communication between team members doesn't happen, even if everyone does there role properly. So the project manager will ensure everything runs smoothly. I personally won't be great for this role because I am not a great leader and I can be strict sometimes, which people usually do not like.</p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Product Manager: The product manager's role will be somewhat similar to the project manager's role. This person will have to make the all of the development engineers' products work well together and recieve information from the QA engineer on how to improve the product. This role will not be great for me because I do not like to work with integration. I also would not want the pressure of the entire project on me.</p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Release Engineer: The relaease engineer deals with the deployment of the source code into the program. The relase engineer ensures that the code in the software is ready for distribution. Release engineer are usually found working on complex programs and software. I do not really think we need a release engineer and I do not fully understand their role in our project specifically so I definetly would not choose this role.</p>
