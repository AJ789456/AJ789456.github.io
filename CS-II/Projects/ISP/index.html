    <h1>11th Grade ISP</h1>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ISP I worked on in 11th grade was the front of a model scheduler that was used by the entire school to help during arena scheduling. At Allen High School, the students use a system known as arena scheduling to choose the order of the classes they chose during the course selction period. Since the arena scheduling window is short and stressful, we decided to create a model scheduler to help the students plan the order of their classes because most classes aren't offered at all times in the day. The model scheduler had two parts: the front end and the back end. I decided to join the team working on the front end. On this team, I designed the UI that the students of AHS actually interacted with. Previous model schedulers, frankly, had been ugly or unintuitive, so my team and I wanted to change that. And, I would say we successfully accomplished that.<br><br></p>
