    <h2>Identity</h2>
    <p> Smartshop </p>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p> Many people don’t know what to wear, especially the people in this ISP group. We are not fashionable. But that doesn’t mean that we want to look like hobos; we want to be well dressed. But getting well dressed takes way too much time, and shopping for the outfit takes even more time. The process of dressing well takes a lot of time. One must watch for trends in styles, then search for clothes that reflect one’s personal style and general trends, and finally, find good deals for those clothes. This takes way too much brain power and time. </p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p> Our application will find out information about the user such as their interests and then scour the internet for clothes that match those interests. It will then filter through those, selecting only ones that reflect current trends that will be input by us. Finally, the application will go back to the internet looking for the store selling for the lowest price. </p>
    <h2>Target Market</h2>
    <p> Our target market is people interested in dressing well who just don’t have enough time to do so. These people will be able to find outfits easily and quickly, enabling them to dress better. </p>
    <h2>Competition</h2>
    <p> Since our product is fairly unique there is not much competition. However, Google and Amazon’s clothing recommender might give us a little competition. </p>
    <h2>Revenue Streams</h2>
    <p> Our main revenue stream will be through affiliate marketing. This is where stores will pay us for sending our users to buy from them. </p>
    <h2>Marketing Activities</h2>
    <p> We will show this to all the high schoolers at our school and when it catches on it will spread like a wildfire, like every trend in America. </p>
    <h2>Expenses</h2>
    <p> This project does not have any expenses other than labor because all that we need to do is program the app and publish it. </p>
    <h2>Team and Key Roles</h2>
    <p> Reynard - recommendation software programmer <br> MD Raeed - recommendation software programmer, trend researcher <br> Isaac - recommendation software programmer, trend researcher <br> Kevin - UI programmer <br> Avanish - UI programmer </p>
    <h2>Milestones</h2>
    <p> 1. Finalize idea <br> 2. Research trends <br> 3. Program recommendation software <br> 4. Program UI <br> 5. Market(advertise) application </p>
