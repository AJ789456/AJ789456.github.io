    <p style="font-family:verdana;"> My team and I created a 2D car game where the player had to avoid obstacles that appeared on the road. <br> The goal of the game was to drive as far as possible without hitting any obstacles. We named the game "Don't Crash." <br> We wanted to create this game because it would be fun to play and adequately challenging to create.<br> Below is a screenshot of the game.</p>
