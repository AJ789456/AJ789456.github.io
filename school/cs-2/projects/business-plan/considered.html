    <h1>Considered Proposals</h1>
    <h2> The City Planner </h2>
    <p> This is a decent idea for people who want to get involved in the community. But that is also the problem; not many people want to get involved in community events. I think that this idea won’t catch on and there will be no revenue. Cities, like Allen, would probably prefer to mail an occasional magazine, like the Life in Allen magazines that Allen residents receive in the mail. Spreading awareness on this application would also be difficult because frankly, people who want to go the community events are probably fine with the Life in Allen magazines and are not looking for an improvement. </p>
    <h2> SchoolFood </h2>
    <p> This is a great idea because it would save so many students so much time. But the problem is that you need to change the software on all the cash registers that the cafeterias use. The only way for the cafeteria workers to know what you ordered when you scan your ID to pay is to update the software on all the cash registers and if they are not already internet connected, the cash registers themselves would need to be upgraded. But if this team wanted to use an external device to see what the student ordered, then buying the device would be another expense that would make this a larger investment that I do not think they are ready for. </p>
    <h2> One Wheeler </h2>
    <p> This is a pre-existing idea. As it was mentioned in the business proposal, this idea already exists and the company behind this idea is fairly popular. Creating a product so similar to the OneWheel would not get much support. The OneWheel is already a great product that has several years of R&D put into. It would be near impossible to get any customers for this product. Also, if this group was thinking of a different design for a one-wheeled-transportation-device, that idea probably exists too, the Ninebot One S1. </p>
    <h2> Foob </h2>
    <p> This is another pre-existing idea. Like the previous proposal, this product already exists. Supercook is a great application that has been up for several years. Competing with this company would be very hard; their app in the Google Play Store has one million downloads and 4.7 star rating. Nobody would choose this app over Supercook. Also, uploading enough recipes to the app to make the users (who have many different combinations of ingredients) happy is no easy task and their GANTT chart shows that they plan to complete all the recipe work in 2 weeks. </p>
    <h2> Preadtionware </h2>
    <p> This is an okay idea. Many people who want a custom-built PC want to do it on their own because it is more fun that way. And people who don’t want to build their own PC would choose to buy it. Not all prebuilt gaming PCs are bad. Also, the labor required to build a PC for every customer is too much so this is not practical. And the customer may not trust a teenager with no qualifications to build their PC and send it to them. </p>
    <h2> Bolt </h2>
    <p> This is a decent idea. This idea is something that basically already exists. Computer science has tutoring many, many evenings. If a student has a quick question, they can always just send their teacher a Remind message. Nobody would pay $3/month for something that is already free to them. Also, the expense of hiring top tutors or a professor is way too much. This idea will go bad very quickly and the creators will probably be in debt. </p>
    <h2> Aerofli </h2>
    <p> This is simply an extremely difficult project. Programming an AI to fly a plane will be extremely difficult for an ISP. Tesla has been working on AI for a car for several years and they still haven’t figured out how to make it work, so there is no way several high school students could program an AI for a plane. Also, if we do manage to create this AI, getting approval from the government to put this in a commercial plane will take a very long time. This idea simply requires too much effort. </p>
    <h2> Project 1984 </h2>
    <p> This is a great idea, but the idea is not fully developed. Using a broken-beam sensor is not a great idea because if two people walk in through the door side by side the scanner will only look for one RFID tag. This system can also be cheated really easily because students could just buy an RFID tag off Amazon and stick it on their backpack. This way they will never have to wear their ID. Also, the school may not approve of this. </p>
    <h2> The Symptoms Quiz </h2>
    <p> This is a great idea, but it will require a lot of research. Creating this product will require researching illnesses so much. There are thousands of different illnesses, some have very similar symptoms. The symptoms quiz might also be long if the user wants an accurate diagnosis. Also, not everyone experiences the same symptoms making this even more challenging. And finally taking this quiz would feel like one of those pick your own adventure type of things and I think it will be hard to make this app look polished and sophisticated. </p>
    <h2> SmartShop </h2>
    <p> Finally, I decided to accept my original proposal. I really like the idea of an app recommending clothing choices because fashionable is something that I am not. I often get criticized for this because my friends are fashionable. Some people think that making this product will take a lot of time and effort but they don’t realize that we could use APIs instead of importing everything ourselves. I think many of my friends will also find it useful, so we will make a profit. </p>
