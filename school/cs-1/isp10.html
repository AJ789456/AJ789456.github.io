    <h1>10th grade ISP</h1>
    <p> My team and I created a 2D car game where the player had to avoid obstacles that appeared on the road. The goal of the game was to drive as far as possible without hitting any obstacles. We named the game "Don't Crash." We wanted to create this game because it would be fun to play and adequately challenging to create. Below is a screenshot of the game.<br><br> </p>
