    <h1>Steel Bridge</h1>
    <p>
      Steel Bridge was the first club I joined in college. 
      In my first year on the team, I gained a lot of experience in metal fabrication, and I learned about the structure of the competition and how it affected the bridge's design. 
      Although we didn't win any of the major awards, I had a lot of fun in my first year on the team. 
      Now, in my second year on the team, I get to do a lot more teaching and supervision, which is another new experience for me.
      I make sure I continue learning about design and fabrication, but being able teach new members is fun.
      I'm looking forward to this year's competition because our pace this year seems great.
