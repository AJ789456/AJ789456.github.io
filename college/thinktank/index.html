    <h1>Steel Bridge</h1>
    <p>
      ThinkTank was the second club I joined in college, and it was quite the experience.
      I was put on a team whose task was to design a solar-plus-storage system for the Seattle College System. 
      I knew nothing about solar system design coming into this competition-and neither did any of my teammates.
      As a result, we had to learn everything on the fly as we put together a project proposal that would compete with much more experienced students from other colleges. 
      This competition was intense due to the tight timelines and difficulty of the task.
      It wasn't always enjoyable, but it was a good experience in the end.
