    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hi! My name is Avanish. I'm currently a high school junior. I have a passion for new technology and cars. I plan to major in mechanical engineering, but I'm not a hundred percent sure I will. I am a part of the Allen robotics team, so I do have some experience with engineering. I usually enjoy programming, but not when I don't have freedom to choose what I want to make. The one sport that I play is badminton. I don't really have a regular passtime; I just like to read/research about the lastest cars and technology. I was born in New Jersey, but I moved to Texas in 2015. Some of my current goals are getting an internship (hopefully at NASA) and getting into the University of Texas at Austin. I am not allowed to provide anymore information because this is a public website.</p>
