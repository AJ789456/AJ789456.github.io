    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hi! My name is Avanish. I'm currently a freshman at Texas A&M University. I am passionate about new technology and cars. I plan to major in mechanical engineering after I get through general engineering this year. I just got accepted into TAMU ThinkTank, so I will have experience with systems engineering very soon as I work to design a solar-and-storage system. I usually enjoy programming, but I enjoy 3D deisgn and prototyping more. The one sport that I play is badminton, but I enjoy watching others like football and F1. I don't really have a regular passtime; I just like to read/research/watch about the lastest cars, technology, and natural science. I was born in New Jersey, but I moved to Texas in 2015. Some of my current goals are getting an internship (hopefully at a consumer technology company) and develop my own mobile game.</p>
