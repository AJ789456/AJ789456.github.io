    <h1>ID Holder Multi-tool</h1>
    <h2>NASA HUNCH Design and Prototype</h2>	
    <h2>Allen ISD STEAM Center, Allen, TX</h2>
    <h2>Avanish Jeendru and Sam Hamad</h2>
    <p><br>NASA employees will no longer have to go search for simple tools thanks to the ID Holder Multi-tool. This tool provides them with quick access to frequently used tools.</p>
    <h2><br>Failures and Redos:</h2>
    <h3>Generation 1:</h3>
    <p>The 1st generation prototype had a ruler with messy numbers, a flimsy screwdriver and a slot that couldn't hold an ID. It was completely useless.</p>
    <h3>Generation 2:</h3>
    <p>The 2nd generation prototype also had a flimsy screwdriver, but the slot could hold an ID (if it had been wider), and the numbers of the ruler looked good. This generation showed us we had to make drastic changes.</p>
    <h3>Generation 3:</h3>
    <p>The 3rd generation prototype was completely redesigned. It had a laser, bit-holder, pencil-holder, and 2 usable rulers. This came at the cost of weight and thickness, but we decided it was an acceptable compromise. The ID holder was split into 3 parts which was unnecessary.</p>
    <h3>Generation 4:</h3>
    <p>The 4th generation prototype was very similar to the 3rd generation just slightly more refined since the ID holder aws split into only 2 parts instead of 3. We also improved the laser in this generation by making the button easier to press and the laser easier to assemble by integrating a wiring channel.</p>
