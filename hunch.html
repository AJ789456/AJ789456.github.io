    <h1>ID Holder Multi-tool</h1>
    <h2>NASA HUNCH Design and Prototype</h2>	
    <p><br>NASA employees will no longer have to go search for simple tools thanks to the ID Holder Multi-tool. This tool provides them with quick access to frequently used tools.</p>
    <h2><br>CAD Walk-Thru:</h2>
    <p>ID holder: We began by sketching a rectangle and extruding it to create the ID holder body. Then, we created a reactangle slightly smaller than the area of a typically credit card to cut out from the larger one. This will become the lip that holds the ID card. Finally, we cut out slot as thick as a credit card in the previously-made extrusion. To make the ID holder smoother, we rounded all the sharp edges.</p>
    <p>Screwdriver: We start by cutting a flat portion off a corner of the ID holder. Then, we used the chamfer feature to make the screwdriver come to a narrower edge.</p>
    <p>Rulers: First, we sketched the numbers on the side of the ID holder on both sides using the text feature. Then, we can just cut the text out from the body to inscribe the the numbers.</p>
